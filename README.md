1. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing:**
   - Explored the diabetes dataset, checking its shape and descriptive statistics.
   - Ensured no missing values were present in the dataset.
   - Visualized correlations between numerical features and explored age-grouped data.
   - Utilized various plots to understand data distributions and relationships.

2. **Feature Selection:**
   - Employed an Extra Trees Classifier to determine feature importance scores.

3. **Model Building and Evaluation:**
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Implemented classification models such as Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Classifier, Decision Tree, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
   - Evaluated model performance using accuracy scores and confusion matrices.
   - Created a data preprocessing pipeline including imputation and standardization, followed by fitting a Random Forest classifier.
   - Assessed the pipeline's performance using cross-validation and calculated accuracy on the test set.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Identified Logistic Regression as the top-performing model, closely followed by XGBoost and Random Forest.
   - Cross-validation yielded a mean accuracy score of approximately 76.87% on the training set, while the test set accuracy was approximately 63.64%.
